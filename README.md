# A GCP-based CI/CD Template For Deploying a Static Website to AWS

## What is this for?

This repo is intended to provide a pattern or template for anyone wishing to create a [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) pipeline in GCP for a version controlled static website, deployed to AWS.

If you want to rapidly get a static site up and running use best practises, then this template is for you.

Features:
* CDN Hosting
* Content served over HTTP2 ([which can be faster](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/will-http2-make-my-site-faster))
* Content managed using [gitflow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html)
* Automatic creation of new environments based on feature branch


## Who Am I?

My name is [Chris Priest](https://chrisprie.st), and I am a Senior Consultant working for Cloud-first Consultancy [Amido](https://amido.com).

## Why...
 
### ...AWS for the static site?

AWS provides a world-class infrastructure for hosting static sites ([S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)), including a huge CDN ([CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)) that supports HTTP2, where certificates are automatically managed. It is very cost effective to run, and serverless. TODO linke serverless to Paul Johnston's definition on twitter.

This means that sites hosted like this are served fast, and they are secure, which is good for SEO.

### ...Google Cloud Build for the build?

GBP's build system ([Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/)) does not have the fanciest of UIs, nor does it come with a nice UI for configuring every build step. But it does come with a generous free allowance (of 120 minutes per day), a high level of configurability (which is inherently IaaC), and it is fast.

## Origins

This template was forged from the sweat, tears & lessons learned of deploying the [author's own website](https://chrisprie.st), a static site that is optimised for load performance.

## Deployment Topology

TODO

## Prerequisites 

* Access to a GCP Account (if you don't have one, you can get [$300 free credit](https://cloud.google.com/free/) for the first 12 months)
* An AWS Account
* A git repo
* The Google Cloud SDK installed (`brew cask install google-cloud-sdk`, and don't forget to run `gcloud init`)
    * You may need to add the Homebrew Cask tap (`brew tap caskroom/cask`) if you haven't done so before
* The AWS CLI installed (`brew install awscli`, and don't forget to run `aws configure`)

## How is this achieved?

There are several components to the CI/CD pipeline created with this template.

### Google Cloud Build

Google Cloud Build provides the compute and build infrastructure required to process our CI/CD pipeline. 

### Google Cryptographic Keys / Key Management Service

In order to manage secrets, the Google Key Management Service is used. This enables us to encrypt sensitive information, and then include it in build scripts and repos etc

### Google Cloud Storage

Google Cloud Storage is used to store the Terraform state (using the Terraform GCS backend). 

### Terraform

Terraform is driven by Google Cloud Build and is responsible for configuring infrastructure in AWS. Support is provided by a custom Terraform Cloud Builder (based on the [community Terraform Cloud Builder](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/terraform)) which has the addition of the `jq` tool for processing terraform output data for use downstream, that we need to build ourselves

### AWS CLI

The AWS CLI is used to sync the static site data between the build artifacts and the appropriate S3 bucket. As the AWS CLI is not available as one of the standard Google Cloud Builders (unsurprisingly) support is provided by a [community Cloud Builder](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/awscli) that we need to build ourselves

## How to use this template

### What you will need to know beforehand

| Thing you'll need to know | Where to get it | What used in below steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GCP Project ID | Either `gcloud projects list` on the command line or look in the project drop down list at the top of the GCP Console. If you don't have a project for this particular application, [create one](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) | `test-1-236419` |
| GCP Cloud Build Service Account Number | It appears that the only way to get the account name is to go to the GCP Console > IAM & Admin > IAM and copy out the member name | `1027676702318` |
| Administrator AWS Access Key & Secret Key | When you create your initial AWS user (the same one you probably configured your AWS CLI to use) you'll get access to your Access Key & Secret Key | N/A |

### Steps

These steps should be enough to take you from nothing to a fully working GCP Cloud Build CI/CD pipeline deploying a 'hello world' website.

1. Create the AWS user that will be used by Google Cloud Build to communicate with AWS
    1. Create the user: `aws iam create-user --user-name gcp-cloud-build-user`
    1. Assign permissions to the user:
        1. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name gcp-cloud-build-user --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess`
        1. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name gcp-cloud-build-user --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudFrontFullAccess`
        1. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name gcp-cloud-build-user --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonAPIGatewayAdministrator`
        1. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name gcp-cloud-build-user --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonRoute53FullAccess`
    1. Create an Access Key & Secret Key: `aws iam create-access-key --user-name gcp-cloud-build-user`. **Be sure to take note of the `SecretAccessKey` element of the JSON output in particular, as you do not get a chance to see this again**
1. In the GCP Console, under your Project, Enable various APIs by going to APIs & Services > Library and searching for, and enabling, the following APIs:
    1. Cloud Build API
    1. Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API
1. (TODO command line) Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket for storing Terraform state
    1. In the GCP Console, go to Storage, and create a new bucket
    1. The parameters of the bucket (storage class, access control model etc) aren't necessarily of concern. If you are worried, just go with the defaults
    1. Make a note of the name of the bucket, you'll need it later
1. Create Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) Key Rings & CryptoKeys for GCS & AWS
    1. Create a key ring for GCS: `gcloud kms keyrings create gcs --location=global`
    1. Create a `deploy` key for deploying with GCS: `gcloud kms keys create deploy --location=global --keyring=gcs --purpose=encryption`
    1. Grant the Cloud Build service account access to decrypting with the GCS key: `gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding deploy --location=global --keyring=gcs --member=serviceAccount:1027676702318@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyDecrypter`
    1. Create a key ring for AWS: `gcloud kms keyrings create aws --location=global`
    1. Create a `deploy` key for deploying with AWS with this command `gcloud kms keys create deploy --location=global --keyring=aws --purpose=encryption`
    1. Grant the Cloud Build service account access to decrypting with the AWS key: `gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding deploy --location=global --keyring=aws --member=serviceAccount:1027676702318@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyDecrypter`
1. Create Service Account credentials & key file for terraform to use to access state in the GCS bucket
    1. Create the new service account: `gcloud iam service-accounts create terraform-state`
    1. Assign the Storage Object Admin role to the service account: `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding test-1-236419 --member "serviceAccount:terraform-state@test-1-236419.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role "roles/storage.objectAdmin"`
    1. Generate the key file: `gcloud iam service-accounts keys create gcs-terraform-state-credentials.json --iam-account terraform-state@test-1-236419.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. **Keep the generated `gcs-terraform-state-credentials.json` file safe!**
1. Encrypt the GCS bucket key file using the previously generated CryptoKey for GCS
    1. Encrypt the file: `gcloud kms encrypt --plaintext-file=gcs-terraform-state-credentials.json --ciphertext-file=gcs-terraform-state-credentials.json.enc --location=global --keyring=gcs --key=deploy`
    1. Destroy the original: `rm gcs-terraform-state-credentials.json`
1. Encrypt the AWS Secret Access Key using the previously generated CryptoKey for AWS
    1. Encrypt the secret access key (Note: use the `SecretAccessKey` obtained earlier when you created the `gcp-cloud-build-user` user: `echo -n SecretAccessKey | gcloud kms encrypt --plaintext-file=- --ciphertext-file=- --location=global --keyring=aws --key=deploy | base64`
    1. Capture the output for use as `[ENCRYPTED_AWS_SECRET_KEY]` later
1. Build the Terraform and AWS CLI Google Cloud Builders. Once built, they will be available Google Build steps
    1. Change directory to `infrastructure/terraform-cloudbuilder` and run `build.sh`
    1. Change directory to `infrastructure/aws-cli-cloudbuilder` and run `build.sh`
1. Create a Google Cloud Build trigger
    1. In the GCP Console, go to Triggers and create a trigger
    1. Choose your source repository hosting option. This template has only been tested with Github, but I suspect that other hosting options will not be problematic
    1. Authenticate, select your repo.
    1. For Trigger settings, take note of your selections, but you can likely leave almost all settings as their default. Be sure to change the Build configuration to `Cloud Build configuration file (yaml or json)` and change the Cloud Build configuration file location to `/cloudbuild.json`
    1. Click Create Trigger to complete the trigger creation process    

### Configuration

The CI/CD pipeline is configured in `cloudbuild.json` in the root of your repo. The things that you will need to change in this file are:

| Configuration Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `[GCP_PROJECT_ID]` | Your GCP project ID |
| `[TF_STATE_BUCKET]` | The name of the GCP Storage bucket that will be used to store Terraform state |
| `[AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID]` | The AWS access key associated with the AWS user `gcp-cloud-build-user` |
| `[ENCRYPTED_AWS_SECRET_KEY]` | The encrypted and base64 encoded secret key associated with the AWD user `gcp-cloud-build-user` |
| `[WEBSITE_DOMAIN]` | The domain of the website that you are deploying to |
| `[HOSTED_ZONE_ID]` | The ID of the hosted zone in Route 53 relating to your root domain name |
